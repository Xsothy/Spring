## Complete Demo Workflow

Here's a complete workflow demonstrating all API operations:

### 1. Check initial students
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/students"
```

### 2. Get student count
```bash  
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/students/count"
```

### 3. Create a new student
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/students" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "New Bob Wilson",
    "sex": "Male",
    "email": "bob.wilson@email.com", 
    "score": 87
  }'
```

### 4. Get the newly created student
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/students/6"
```

### 5. Update the student's score
```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8080/students/6" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Bob Wilson",
    "sex": "Male", 
    "email": "bob.wilson@email.com",
    "score": 92
  }'
```

### 6. Verify the update
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/students/6"
```

### 7. Delete the student
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/students/6"
```

### 8. Verify deletion
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/students/6"
# Should return 404 Not Found
```

### 9. Check final student list
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/students"
```

## Error Handling

The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes:

- **200 OK** - Successful GET requests
- **201 Created** - Successful POST requests  
- **204 No Content** - Successful DELETE requests
- **404 Not Found** - When student ID doesn't exist
- **400 Bad Request** - Invalid request data

---

## Testing with Different Tools

### Using curl with formatted output:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/students" | jq '.'
```

### Using curl with verbose output:
```bash
curl -v -X GET "http://localhost:8080/students"
```

### Using Postman:
Import the following requests into Postman:
- GET http://localhost:8080/students
- GET http://localhost:8080/students/1  
- POST http://localhost:8080/students

## Initial Sample Data

The application starts with the following sample students:

1. **John Doe** - Male, john.doe@email.com, Score: 85
2. **Jane Smith** - Female, jane.smith@email.com, Score: 92  
3. **Mike Johnson** - Male, mike.johnson@email.com, Score: 78
4. **Emily Davis** - Female, emily.davis@email.com, Score: 89

**Note:** This is an in-memory API, so all data will be reset when the application restarts.
